Let's take this opportunity to review how to get a free environment to get started.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sign-up-for-the-power-apps-developer-plan">Sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan<a class="hash-link" href="#sign-up-for-the-power-apps-developer-plan" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The Power Apps Developer Plan gives you a free development environment to build and test with Power Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft Dataverse.
It just takes a few minutes to get a developer environment for Power Platform:</p><ol><li>Ensure that you have a work account. If you don't,&nbsp;you can <a href="#do-i-need-a-test-tenant">create a test tenant first.</a></li><li>Sign up on the&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/devplan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power Apps Developer Plan website</a>.</li><li>Once the sign up is complete, you will be redirected to your new developer environment.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Power Apps Developer Plan - sign up process" src="/Low-Code/assets/images/01 - devplan signup-3afa66fd4f7c0edb8e766ff2cc60b9c0.gif" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q">

If you already have an Azure account, you likely can use the same account to sign up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to <code>Day 02</code> of #30DaysOfLowCode!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-well-cover">What We'll Cover<a class="hash-link" href="#what-well-cover" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><ul><li>What is Low Code?</li><li>How are the Benefits? </li><li>What does Power Platform Provide?</li><li>How can we extend Power Platform?</li><li><strong>Activity</strong>: Join the <a href="https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud Skills Challenge</a></li><li><strong>Resources</strong>: Explore the <a href="https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Low Code February Collection</a></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="You say Low, I say Code!" src="/Low-Code/assets/images/30-02-ab81170656cc54b7b96147d661b72ae8.png" width="1001" height="420" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="you-say-low-i-say-code">You say Low, I say Code!<a class="hash-link" href="#you-say-low-i-say-code" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>There is a low code revolution underway. We have a surging digital demand with an estimated 500 million more apps that will need to be created in the next 5 years. More and more companies are leveraging low code and no code platforms to bridge this app gap and address workflow and automation needs. In fact, Gartner estimates that 65% of application development will be low code by 2024.</p><p>With low code tools like the Power Platform making it easier for business technologists to develop solutions, you might wonder if there's any room for a code first developer in this low code revolution. Well, the answer is, absolutely there is! In fact, code first developers are a critical piece to the puzzle.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-low-code">What is "low code"?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-low-code" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The term "low code" can mean different things to different people when they first hear it. What we mean when we talk about low code is that with tools like Power Apps, you only need to write a small amount of code to get results that would normally take several more lines of code in a traditional programming language.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="What is Low Code" src="/Low-Code/assets/images/02_WhatIsLowCode-4f9966b58f106fe0bb5d6d4da968dd5a.png" width="1937" height="1070" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In canvas-based Power Apps, the low code scripting language used is called <a href="https://aka.ms/LearnPowerFx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power Fx</a>. This language is based on the Microsoft Excel formula language which meets many business technologists where they are by leveraging the knowledge they already have.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="low-code--full-code--no-cliffs">Low Code + Full Code = No Cliffs<a class="hash-link" href="#low-code--full-code--no-cliffs" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Using low-code tools is key to helping to resolve the existing and impending app gap challenge but that doesn't mean that low code alone can solve every business problem. Low code tools like the Power Platform's full potential is unlocked when you combine the low code capabilities with code first development.</p><p>The combination of low code + full code creates what we call a "no cliffs" experience that allows business technologists to easily build solutions with low code while professional developers can leverage full code to augment and extend the platform capabilities. The process of low code developers, IT pros and full code developers working together like this is often referred to as "fusion development".</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Fusion Development Process" src="/Low-Code/assets/images/02_FusionDevProcess-1d75a4cfd7019909a56ca5ca3499316d.png" width="1937" height="1070" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-the-power-platform-provide">What does the Power Platform Provide?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-does-the-power-platform-provide" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The Power Platform gives us a holistic suite of low code tools that work together to help us solve business problems. The key products and components of the Power Platform include:</p><ul><li><strong>Power Apps</strong> for creating custom applications for web and mobile that can be integrated with a variety of systems and services.</li><li><strong>Power Automate</strong> for automation tasks and orchestrating activities across various services</li><li><strong>Power BI</strong> for business analytics and interactive data visualization</li><li><strong>Power Virtual Agents</strong> for creating AI-powered chatbots that can answer questions from your customers and employees</li><li><strong>Power Pages</strong> for secure, enterprise-grade external-facing business websites</li><li><strong>Dataverse</strong> which provides a cloud scale data store with robust security that abstracts away data management complexity from the app maker</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Power Platform Overview" src="/Low-Code/assets/images/02_PowerPlatformOverview-78e3e950cd1ecb102d264eca0db14efa.png" width="1254" height="581" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-can-we-extend-power-platform-solutions">How can we extend Power Platform solutions?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-can-we-extend-power-platform-solutions" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>You might wondering how you can leverage your code first skills with the Power Platform.
