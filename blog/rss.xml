Low-code development with Azure helps businesses accelerate their innovation cycle and make the most out of their data resources. </p><p>Low-code app development through Microsoft Power Platform and Azure can be used to automate workflows, reduce manual efforts, and speed up the development process for building line-of-business apps at a lower cost.</p><p>According to <a href="https://aka.ms/2022ForresterTEI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Forrester</strong></a>, composite organizations experience benefits of <strong>140% ROI</strong> and <strong>45% cost reduction</strong> in app development when using Power Platform premium capabilities.
