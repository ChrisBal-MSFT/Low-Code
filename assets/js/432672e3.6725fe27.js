Low-code development with Azure helps businesses accelerate their innovation cycle and make the most out of their data resources. \\n\\nLow-code app development through Microsoft Power Platform and Azure can be used to automate workflows, reduce manual efforts, and speed up the development process for building line-of-business apps at a lower cost.\\n\\nAccording to [**Forrester**](https://aka.ms/2022ForresterTEI), composite organizations experience benefits of **140% ROI** and **45% cost reduction** in app development when using Power Platform premium capabilities. The majority of users say Power Platform\u2019s premium capabilities increase revenue and offers faster solution quoting through better data integration. \\n\\nIn other words, with Power Platform you\u2019ll produce more and better code than before, with increased cost savings. That means developing more projects and delivering increased value to your clients. With low code, everyone wins!\\n\\n![Empty Banner Placeholder](./01%20-%20Kickoff.png)\\n\\n## The full Low-Code February lineup\\n\\nWe want to give developers the resources you need to enhance your knowledge and skill in low code.
