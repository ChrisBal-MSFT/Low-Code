So far, we\'ve talked about Power Platform Connectors - from [built-in options](/blog/2023-day6) to [serverless computing solutions](/blog/2023-day8) with automated workflows triggered by connectors. But what if prebuilt connectors don\'t support _your_ requirements? That\'s where **custom connectors** come in. Join us today for a 2-part tutorial as we take you step-by-step through the process of _building, testing, and using_ a custom connector! \\n\\n:::info SEE US LIVE AT POWERFUL DEVS!\\nJoin us Feb 15 at the #PowerfulDevs conference where Daniel and Nitya will walk through the steps of building the connector and application - and more!\\n[**Register Here**](https://learn.microsoft.com/events/learn-events/powerful-devs-2023/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi)\\n:::\\n\\n\\n## What We\'ll Cover\\n * **Motivation** - Why are custom connectors needed?\\n * **Scenario** - Let\'s build a dev.to Connector!\\n * **Process** - Building from an OpenAPI specification\\n * **Testing** - Validate it works!\\n * **Exercise**: [Training: Build custom connectors for Power Automate](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/build-custom-connectors/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi&ns-enrollment-type=Collection&ns-enrollment-id=xz6ehr2mx031y0)\\n * **Resources**: Explore the [Low Code February Collection](https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/collection)\\n\\n![Building a Custom Connector](./../../../static/img/og/30-09-01.png)\\n\\n\x3c!-- ************************************* --\x3e\\n\x3c!--  AUTHORS: ONLY UPDATE BELOW THIS LINE --\x3e\\n\x3c!-- ************************************* --\x3e\\n\\n## Why Custom Connectors?\\n\\nFrom [the earlier post](/blog/2023-day6) we know Connectors are wrappers around APIs that make it easier for low-code developers to take actions and trigger workflows based on API-supported operations. And we know there are [900+ pre-built connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/connector-reference/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi)  for Power Platform.\\n\\n_So why would I want to build a custom connector?_ We can think of three reasons:\\n 1. **The API exists, but connector does not** - and you need to work with the API!\\n 2. **The connector exists, but it\'s not perfect** - you need a more customized or complete version.\\n 3. **The API is being built by you** - and you want to build a connector in parallel, to drive usage.\\n\\nAs a JavaScript Cloud Advocate, this was exactly the situation I faced when I wanted to explore the low-code ecosystem from a pro-developer perspective. I had a specific scenario I wanted to implement and the API existed **but the connector did not**! \\n\\nSo I reached out to my colleague Daniel (Power Platform Cloud Advocate) and his response was immediate: _Let\'s build a custom connector!!_. Alright then!\\n\\n## Our Target Scenario\\n\\nYou might know that there is an [Azure publication on dev.to](https://dev.to/azure), a community-driven content portal where cloud advocates publish tutorials, tips and best practices for developers. We have 100+ contributors on that publication, and each post can have up to 4 tags. We wanted to view the content in different ways, but the default dev.to dashboard only shows us a chronological view. So here\'s our scenario:\\n\\n:::info USER SCENARIO\\nAs a user, I want to see a list of articles from dev.to\\n - for the Azure organization\\n - for a specific user\\n - for a specific tag\\n\\nwhere each item should provide {publication date, author, tags, description, link}.\\n:::\\n\\nThe good news? The dev.to site is built on a platform called Forem - [which has an API](https://developers.forem.com/) that provides _exactly_ the kinds of operations (e.g., `/articles`) that can help us build this dashboard scenario. But there is no _prebuilt connector_ for this API, so it was time to build one!\\n\\n\\n## The Build Lifecycle\\n\\nThe Power Platform [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/#lifecycle?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) describes this 5-step process for building a custom connector:\\n\\n![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/media/index/authoring-steps.png)\\n\\n 1. **Build & Secure it** - applicable only if you are building the API itself. We are not, so we can skip it.\\n 2. **Define it** - this is where you describe the methods and metadata in the API. You can hand-craft this _or_ use standardized options (OpenAPI file or Postman collection) to build from.\\n 3. **Use it** - create a connection to your Connector from a client, and validate it works!\\n 4. **Share it** - make the connector available to people within your organization to use.\\n 5. **Certify it** - submit it for Microsoft certification if you want this available to all users.\\n\\n\\n## Let\'s Build the Connector!\\n\\nWe\'ll follow the guidelines in [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/#tutorial?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi). \\n\\n### 1. Pre-Requisites\\n\\nTo get started, you will need the following:\\n * **Subscription** - to Azure (if using Azure Logic Apps), Power Automate, or Power Apps.\\n * **Familiarity** - with core concepts of Logic Apps, Power Automate flows, or Power Apps.\\n * **API Key** - to the Forem API, if using authenticated endpoints\\n\\nNote that currently Power Plaform supports only [OpenAPI v2.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/define-openapi-definition#prerequisites?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) - and the dev.to API uses OpenAPI 3.x.  We can work around this in two ways:\\n 1. Use a converter that downgrades API to v2.0 (knowing you may lose some functionality)\\n 2. Manually re-create API in Custom Connector wizard (using OpenAPI spec as reference)\\n\\nWe\'ll talk briefly about the first option in this post, and encourage you to join us for our [**PowerfulDevs Session**](https://learn.microsoft.com/events/learn-events/powerful-devs-2023/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) where Daniel will walk through the steps for the second option!\\n\\n### 2. Get The DevPlan\\n\\nDon\'t have a Power Apps or Power Automate subscription (see pre-requisites)? Just sign up for the [Power Apps Developer Plan](https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/devplan) and get a free development environment that will work for this purpose. Anyone with a work or school email address (backed by Azure AD) can sign up. Read our earlier post on [**DevTools and Onboarding**](/blog/2023-day3) options to get yourself set up with a sandbox subscription and test tenant.\\n\\n### 3. Connector Wizard\\n\\nVisit the [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/) portal and sign in. You should see something like this:\\n\\n![](./build/1-signin.png)\\n\\nSelect `Data > Custom Connectors` to enter the Custom Connector Wizard. Click the `New custom connector` drop-down to see the different starting options as shown below. Use the **Create from blank** option to build the custom connector manually. We walk through this approach in our [**PowerfulDevs Session**](https://learn.microsoft.com/events/learn-events/powerful-devs-2023/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) on Feb 15 so don\'t miss it!\\n\\n![Screenshot of new connector options](./build/2-options.png)\\n\\n\\n### 4. OpenAPI Converter\\n\\nFor completeness, let\'s also see what happens if we were to try using the _Import an OpenAPI file_ option. First **[download the dev.to OpenAPI file](https://developers.forem.com/api/v1)** to your local drive. Then use the _Import_ option in the wizard to upload this file to the portal. (Note: in my case I used a converter tool to convert the OpenAPI YAML to a JSON file before this step).\\n\\n![Screenshot of OpenAPI error](./build/3-openapi.png)\\n\\nNot surprisingly, we get this error message indicating that the dev.to OpenAPI file uses the v3 specification which is not _yet_ supported. What do we do now?\\n\\nIf you\'re a JavaScript developer, you\'ll likely check npm for a handy converter. And guess what? [**You\'d find one!**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/api-spec-converter) that does exactly what you need. You can even use this directly on the YAML file downloaded from the dev.to API site!\\n\\n![Screenshot of converter README page](./build/4-converter.png)\\n\\nNow use the _Import_ option again but with the converted file and - SUCCESS! \ud83c\udf89 You should be taken into the first step of the Custom Connector creation workflow.\\n\\n### 5. Creation Workflow\\n\\nThe wizard walks you through the 5 key steps of the workflow (see tabs):\\n 1. **General** - defines the metadata for the Connector. Pay attention to the `Host` and `Base URL` fields. These will need to be corrected to align with the API definition. However, importing the file should have filled in details like the `Description`. Customize this by adding your own icon and background color preferences. _Then move to next tab_.\\n 2. **Security** - is the panel where you enter credentials (e.g., API key) required to access the API\\n 3. **Definition** - is the main tab defining the API. We\'ll look at this in the next section.\\n 4. **Code** - The connector can act as a proxy between API and low-code clients. This section allows you to define code that _transforms_ requests or responses in custom ways.\\n 5. **Test** - This pane helps validate your definition with simple in-wizard tests as we see later.\\n\\nFor our current purpose, let\'s dive into the _Definition_ tab for more detail.\\n\\n![Screenshot of Custom Connector Wizard](./build/5-wizard.png)\\n\\n### 6. Edit Definition\\n\\nThe good news is that importing an OpenAPI file will fill in most of the definition details for you. Here, **Actions** are the requests you can make on API (endpoints) - we can see that the default dev.to API endpoints are already defined. Because we downgraded to OpenAPI v2, you may find certain actions throwing _error_ flags.\\n\\n![Screenshot of Definition tab](./build/6-definition.png)\\n\\nYou can use your judgement to delete or edit them manually, till the complete definition is error-free. As a pro-developer, I was particularly happy to see the option to switch to a _Swagger editor_ as shown below. Changes in this editor are kept in sync with the definition, so you can easily move between the wizard UI or this editor, without losing context. The editor view lets you see the raw details of the OpenAPI spec, and the _swagger-ui_ rendered version (at right) for easy debugging.\\n\\n![Screenshot of Swagger Editor](./build/6-swagger.png)\\n\\nOnce you\'ve completed the definition to your satisfaction, take a minute to click _Update connector_ to make sure the changes are saved to the environment. We aren\'t doing any code transformations, so let\'s skip that step and go directly to testing!\\n\\n## Let\'s Test the Connector!\\n\\nAt this point, we\'ve come to the [Step 5: Test the connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/define-blank#step-5-test-the-connector?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) step of the tutorial. **Testing is currently available only in Power Automate and Power Apps**.\\n\\n### 1. Create Connection\\n\\nThe connector is just the wrapper around the API. Before we can use it, we need to associate this with a _Connection_ that provides the required **credentials** (e.g., API key) required to actually use the deployed API endpoint.\\n\\nYou can create a new connection either from the _Connections_ page (see sidebar) or from the Test tab of the wizard itself. Once the Connection is created, you should be taken to the Connections page to verify that it was created correctly. Now we\'re ready to test!\\n\\n![Screenshot of Connections UI](./build/7-connection.png)\\n\\n### 2. Test Connector\\n\\nSwitch back to the Custom Connectors page, select the connector you were working on, and move to the _Test_ tab. You should see something like this - where you can now select the newly created connector as the default Connection for the test.\\n\\n![Screenshot of Testing UI](./build/7-test.png)\\n\\nAt this point, you can simply select the _Action_ (request), provide any necessary parameters, and click `Test operation` to see if you get the correct response. For example, in the screenshot below, you can see the default response for `getUserArticles` returns the last article I published on dev.to! \\n\\n![Screenshot of Test Run response](./build/7-response.png)\\n\\nThis test tab also provides helpful feedback - for instance _schema validation_ - that can help you further debug and fix any issues in the definition, before you share the connector with others.\\n\\n![Screenshot of Schema Validation output](./build/7-schema.png)\\n\\n:::success CONGRATULATIONS \ud83e\udd73\\nYou just built and tested your first custom connector using the dev.to API!\\n:::\\n\\nNote that testing within the wizard helps with improving the _definition_ but it can be laborious to test everything that your intended application will use. Instead, you might be able to test the connector _from an application_ by **using the connector in a Power Apps or Power Automate** implementation.\\n\\n## Next: Use The Connector!\\n\\nWow - we covered a lot today! Here\'s a helpful visual recap for your convenience. We defined our scenario, built our connector, tested it within the Custom Connector wizard, and learned about options for sharing it widely. What\'s next? **Using the connector** in a real-world context, to deliver the rich interactive experience we described in our scenario. **Read Part-2 to see how we used the connector within Power Apps!**.\\n\\n![Building a custom connector](./build/Build-Custom-Connector.png)\\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\nTry building a custom connector yourself, either for the same dev.to API, or for any other OpenAPI-compliant API that you might want to use.

Yesterday we talked about Low Code + Dataverse. Today we\'ll explore the topic of serverless low code and piecing together a workflow with Azure Logic Apps.\\n\\n## What We\'ll Cover\\n\\n* Serverless and Low Code?\\n* Azure Logic Apps overview\\n* Let\'s build a Logic App\\n* Logic Apps compared to Power Automate\\n* Resources\\n\\n![Low Code and Serverless](./../../../static/img/og/30-08.png)\\n\\n\x3c!-- ************************************* --\x3e\\n\x3c!--  AUTHORS: ONLY UPDATE BELOW THIS LINE --\x3e\\n\x3c!-- ************************************* --\x3e\\n\\n## Serverless and Low Code?\\n\\nAre you sitting down? Because I\'m about to tell you that there\'s something out there that combines the best of serverless computing with low code development. And that\'s ... Azure Logic Apps.\\n\\nServerless computing lets you worry less about the underlying infrastructure your code is running on and concentrate more on the code itself.\\n\\nA benefit of serverless computing is that you don\'t write huge applications, instead you write small functions that do one specific task. For example, respond to an HTTP request. Or process a message from a queue.\\n\\nThen within that function, you write code that deals with the task. Any logic, or connections to other services - that\'s pretty much on you to write code for.\\n\\nAzure Logic Apps brings the Low Code world to serverless computing. You still solve a problem in a concise of a manner as possible with a Logic App - and the Logic App is started by some sort of event. But instead of writing code, you use a visual designer to piece together a workflow.\\n\\n## Azure Logic Apps overview\\n\\nAt its heart, Azure Logic Apps automates the execution of business processes by using a visual designer to create workflows.\\n\\nBut what sets Logic Apps apart, are its pre-made components.\\n\\nWhen you\'re creating a Logic App, you arrange pre-made components into a sequence - or a workflow. These components are designed to communicate with external services. So you can specify - all in a visual designer - what event should trigger a workflow to start and then what actions should occur.\\n\\n![A diagram showing the step you\'ll take when building a logic app.](./1-app-design-process.png)\\n\\nAs I mentioned, there are literally hundreds of external services (or components) you can connect your Logic App to. And the beauty of it is, the Logic Apps runtime takes care of managing the connections to the services. You don\'t have to worry about writing code to establish connections or check connectivity - Logic Apps has your back.\\n\\n![A graphic showing various 3rd party services a logic app can connect to.](./2-external-services.png)\\n\\nBuilding a Logic App is the process of building a workflow using the components to solve your business problem. Each component will have different triggers that will start a workflow, and different actions that it can take when a workflow is running. How you use them is up to you.\\n\\n![A diagram showing an example Logic App workflow that detects the sentiment of a tweet.](./3-service-use.png)\\n\\n## Building a Logic App\\n\\nWe\'re not going to create a Logic App from front to back, step-by-step, in this article. That\'s really worth it\'s own article and we have some [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow?WT.mc_id=dotnet-82212-masoucou&WT.mc_id=dotnet-82522-masoucou) that will take you through that process.\\n\\nRather I want to concentrate on the major pieces and decision points that you\'ll make when creating a Logic App.\\n\\n### Connecting to other services\\n\\nNow let\'s pause for a second to talk about all of these services that you can connect your Logic Apps workflow to. A _connector_ is a component that provides an interface to an external service. For example, the Twitter connector allows you to send and retrieve tweets, while the Office 365 Outlook connector lets you manage your email, calendar, and contacts.\\n\\nThere are literally hundreds of connectors from Microsoft and 3rd party vendors that you can use to build your workflows with.\\n\\nA connector uses the external service\'s REST API to do its work. When you use the connector in your Logic App workflow, the connector calls the service\'s underlying API for you.\\n\\n![A diagram of how a connector works](./6-connector.png)\\n\\nIf you can\'t find a connector that suits your needs? You can build one yourself! It\'s called a custom connector, and this [series](https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/?WT.mc_id=dotnet-82212-masoucou&WT.mc_id=dotnet-82522-masoucou) of [articles](https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/create-logic-apps-connector?WT.mc_id=dotnet-82212-masoucou&WT.mc_id=dotnet-82522-masoucou) will show you how to make your REST API into a connector!\\n\\n### Kicking off the logic\\n\\nThe very first decision you\'ll need to make when creating a Logic App is to decide what type of event, or _trigger_ will start the workflow running. The trigger specifies the condition to meet before any actions defined in the Logic App execute. Each time the trigger fires, the Logic Apps runtime creates and runs the workflow instance.\\n\\nThere are a ton of different triggers you can choose from. A workflow can be started with events as varied as a new email arriving to a new message arriving in an Azure Storage queue.\\n\\n![A screenshot showing the 2 different triggers for an Azure Storage Queue](./5-queue-triggers.png)\\n\\n### Performing actions\\n\\nIf a trigger kicks off a workflow, then an action performs a specific task while the workflow is running.\\n\\nA connector can be composed of many actions and triggers. For example, the Dropbox connector has triggers to monitor for when a file is created or modified. And it has actions to create a file, list files in a folder, and so on.\\n\\n![Diagram showing the Dropbox connector triggers and actions](./7-dropbox-connector-details.png)\\n\\nYou string together actions, after the triggering event, to perform the business logic of your Logic App. But what if your logic had branches or conditions in it?\\n\\n### Controlling actions\\n\\nA control action routes the execution within a workflow based on conditions.\\n\\nConsider the Azure DevOps connector\'s Build Complete trigger kicking off a workflow. If the build status is _failed_, then a text message could be sent using the Azure Communication Service\'s connector. Otherwise if the build status is successful, a message could be posted to a chat in Microsoft Teams using its connector.\\n\\nThe _if_ statement is a conditional action. There are others controlling actions such as _switch_ statements, _for each_ and _until_ loops.\\n\\n## Logic Apps compared to Power Automate\\n\\nNow, you may be thinking to yourself - Logic Apps sound a lot like Power Automate. And you\'re not wrong, they\'re both workflow-based services that work with connectors to other services.\\n\\nIn fact, Power Automate is built upon Azure Logic Apps!\\n\\n### UI\\n\\nThey both have a user-friendly design surface to create your workflow on quickly. The difference is that Logic Apps allows you to build a bit more complex integration solutions and utilize advanced development tooling like Visual Studio or VS Code. Logic Apps has a recently refreshed designer, whereas Power Automate still uses the previous designer and is only accessible via the Power Automate portal.\\n\\n### Connectors\\n\\nOn the connectors level, there are some differences. To make it a bit more clear for you, I have split the connectors section up in two parts:\\n\\n#### Logic Apps only connectors\\n\\nLogic Apps has the following connectors that are only available for Logic Apps:\\n\\n* Azure Functions\\n* IBM 3270/MQ Series\\n* SAP\\n* Data Transformation\\n* Inline Code\\n\\nLogic Apps offers a bunch of rich integrations with enterprise systems like IBM 3270 & MQ. Logic Apps also has a fairly advanced SAP connector which supports RFC, BAPI & IDOC actions. It also receives messages from SAP, which the SAP ERP connector from Power Automate can\'t. Next to the enterprise system connectors, it also offers extra features like Azure Functions integration, Data Transformation & Inline Code.\\n\\n#### Power Automate only connectors\\n\\nPower Automate also has connectors that are only available for Power Automate:\\n\\n* AI Builder\\n* Approvals\\n* Desktop flows\\n* Power Apps\\n* Power Virtual Agents\\n* SAP ERP\\n\\nPower Automate offers rich integration with Power Platform products like AI Builder, Approvals, Desktop flows (Robotic Process Automation aka RPA), Power Apps & Power Virtual Agents. It also has a SAP ERP connector which supports RFCs and BAPIs. It also has  [nice templates](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-deeper-sap-integration-for-the-power-platform/?WT.mc_id=dotnet-82212-masoucou) available that they have built since the [Clear Software acquisition](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/powerplatform/2021/10/22/microsoft-acquires-clear-software-to-enhance-connectivity-to-systems-of-record/?WT.mc_id=dotnet-82212-masoucou).\\n\\n### Licensing\\n\\nThe licensing model is also different, I\'ve listed the characteristics below:\\n\\n#### Power Automate\\n\\nPower Automate is licensed on a per-user, per-flow or Pay-as-you-Go basis.\\n\\n* The per user model is the all you can eat model for Power Automate. You can create & use as much flows as you want, as long as your Dataverse storage is big enough & you haven\'t reached your [service limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/api-request-limits-allocations#licensed-user-request-limits?WT.mc_id=dotnet-82212-masoucou&WT.mc_id=dotnet-82522-masoucou). It has a version with and without attended Robotic Process Automation (RPA).\\n* The per flow model is a model that gives you the possibility to let an unlimited number of people within your organization run a flow.\\n* The pay-as-you-go model has been introduced not too long ago, and this is where you pay per flow run.\\n\\n#### Logic Apps Consumption & Logic Apps Standard\\n\\nThere are two types of Logic Apps:\\n\\n* Logic Apps Consumption\\n* Logic Apps Standard\\n\\nLogic Apps Consumption is the type of Logic App that has been around for a while and it\'s the type of Logic App that Power Automate is based on. You pay per execution. And on top of that, you can pay a fixed fee for an Integration Services Environment. A Logic App can contain only one workflow.\\n\\nLogic Apps Standard is a different type of Logic App. You pay a static monthly charge instead of per execution. With Logic Apps Standard, you can have multiple stateful and stateless workflows. You can also host Logic Apps Standard yourself, for instance in a Docker container.\\n\\n### Built-In VNET\\n\\nLogic Apps also has built-in Virtual Network (VNET) configuration included. This is something that Power Automate doesn\'t offer.\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n* Take a [self-paced training course](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/intro-to-logic-apps/?WT.mc_id=dotnet-82212-masoucou&WT.mc_id=dotnet-82522-masoucou) on Azure Logic Apps!\\n* [Azure Logic Apps documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/?WT.mc_id=dotnet-82212-masoucou&WT.mc_id=dotnet-82522-masoucou)\\n* [Power Automate documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-automate/getting-started?WT.mc_id=dotnet-82212-masoucou&WT.mc_id=dotnet-82522-masoucou)"},{"id":"2023-day7","metadata":{"permalink":"/Low-Code/blog/2023-day7","source":"@site/blog/2023-lcf/2023-02-07/index.md","title":"7.

Dataverse, being a hyperscale polyglot storage, can store any type of data (relational, file, observational etc.) for all your transactional or analytical applications. Dataverse is the data platform for all Power Platform products and Dynamics 365 applications, supporting both low-code and pro-code development. It is a critical element of Microsoft Power Platform, supporting all the data, events, analytics, and related processing, besides generating insights for citizen app makers and professional developers to build, store and manage data for their applications. \\n\\n![Figure 1: Microsoft Dataverse and Power Platform](./DataverseRunsOnAzure.png)\\n*Figure 1: Microsoft Dataverse and Power Platform*\\n\\nAll these diverse types of data, in Dataverse, are represented externally as tables, which not only makes it easy for citizen developers to use it as excel but also accelerates design and development time and cost, for professional developers .Dataverse includes a base set of standard tables that cover typical scenarios, also known as [Common Data Model (CDM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/common-data-model/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi), but you can also customize or create new custom tables specific to your needs.\\n\\n## Dataverse -Under the hood \\nDataverse enables integrated, intelligent systems of action of the data that is stored. Dataverse achieves this by leveraging Azure services, so it is built on Azure and extends with Azure. \\n\\n ![Figure 2: Microsoft Dataverse and Power Platform](./DataverseRunsOnAzure.png)\\n\\n*Figure 2: Microsoft Dataverse Runs on Azure & Extends with Azure*\\n\\nAll the building blocks of Dataverse i.e., storage, compute and insights are built on Azure. Similarly, if you need to extend the functionality, you can leverage your existing investments in Azure to augment your customer requirements. \\n\\n## Why Dataverse? ##\\nMicrosoft Dataverse is much more than a database because it provides a managed SaaS data platform experience for citizen developers and professional developers to build, store, and manage data for their applications. It also provides a rich and intelligent computing layer to integrate and act on these diverse types of data through [a rich API layer](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/overview/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi), besides providing analytics and generating insights. \\n\\nLet\u2019s look at some of these salient features of Dataverse. \\n\\n### Enables low-code and pro-code integration of external data\\n\\nDataverse provides an ability to use out of the box power of Power Query via [Power Platform Data Flows](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-query/dataflows/create-use/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi), [Azure Data Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/connector-dynamics-crm-office-365?tabs=data-factory/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi)(ADF) and [Web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/perform-operations-web-api/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) to enable low-code and pro-code developers to integrate external data with Dataverse. With few clicks, users can have a quick start experience to get the data from multitude of data sources specifically from Azure resources into Dataverse with rich, intuitive user experience. Pro dev deeply familiar with data transformations can extend queries and author complex transformations for both ADF and Power Query. A splendid example of using Dataverse data to create reports can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-powerbi-connector?tabs=Dataverse/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi). Another powerful feature about data integration with Dataverse is the introduction of Virtual Tables in Dataverse which allows you to integrate external data without moving it physically into Dataverse. With this new experience, you can create virtual tables from SharePoint and SQL without any code, and without leaving the maker portal. In minutes, you can set up your connection, pick your SharePoint Site or SQL Database, select your SharePoint List or SQL Table, and your virtual table will appear in table hub within [Maker experience](https://make.powerapps.com) ready to use.\\n\\n  ![Figure 3: Creating a Virtual Table in Microsoft Dataverse](./VT_SQL_short_221215_small.gif)\\n*Figure 3 : Creating a Virtual Table in Microsoft Dataverse* \\n\\nYou can try it out for yourself using this detailed [information](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/virtual-tables-creation-wizard-now-in-public-preview/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) \\nAdditional Info: [Virtual tables in Dataverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRTtGEZXNE&list=PL8b8RgcLYAyqDb3hgrVOs-xICPtorzSiK&index=2&ab_channel=MicrosoftPowerPlatform)\\n\\n### Advanced business logic, eventing, analytics, and insights at no additional cost \\nBesides Web API, Dataverse also provides several advanced business logic and eventing features like [calculated fields and rollups](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/calculated-rollup-attributes/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi), and automatic [duplicate detection](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/detect-duplicate-records/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) along with powerful built-in AI, Analytics through Power BI, Azure Cognitive Services and [AI Builder](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/use-ai-builder/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi). Dataverse allows pro-code extensibility via [plug-ins](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/plug-ins/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) and low code extensibility using Power FX, like [formula columns](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/maker/data-platform/formula-columns/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi).\\n\\nAdditionally, there is built-in integration with Azure - With a few clicks, you can use [Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/maker/data-platform/export-to-data-lake/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) to bring your Dataverse data to Azure Synapse, visualize data in your Azure Synapse workspace, and rapidly start processing the data to discover insights using advanced analytics capabilities for serverless data lake exploration, code-free data integration, data flows for extract, transform, load (ETL) pipelines, and optimized Apache Spark for big data analytics. [Here](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/powerplatform/2021/05/26/accelerate-time-to-insight-with-azure-synapse-link-for-dataverse/) is how you can accelerate time to insight with Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse. \\n\\nHere is another glimpse into doing more with [analytics using Dataverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNMYSEN3VeI&list=PL8b8RgcLYAyqDb3hgrVOs-xICPtorzSiK&index=50&ab_channel=MicrosoftPowerPlatform)\\n\\nAll these features are built-in into Dataverse and hence you do not have to spend any additional time or money managing additional compute services outside Dataverse platform which helps in bringing down the total cost of ownership for an end-to-end business solution.\\n\\n### Providing data residency and compliance while scaling globally.\\nDataverse serves customers in 18 distinct geographic locations like Asia Pacific, Canada, Switzerland, France, Germany, UK, India, Japan, China, Korea, Norway, Australia, South America, Singapore, UAE, South Africa, North America, Europe and expanding to more regions. To help your organization comply with national, regional, and industry-specific requirements governing the collection and use of individuals\u2019 data, Dataverse provides a comprehensive set of compliance offerings which you can find [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/wp-compliance-data-privacy/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi).The latest availability information can be found in [Product Availability by Geography](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/availability-reports/georeport/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) under Power Apps product, since Dataverse is the data platform for Power Platform products.\\n\\n### Availability and Reliability that you can depend on\\nDataverse also provides high availability (99.9+ %), reliability features like disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities for your production instance, by leveraging [Azure availability zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) and asynchronous cross-region replications using [Azure paired regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/reliability/cross-region-replication-azure/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi). You can read more about these scenarios and solutions in [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/business-continuity-disaster-recovery/?WT.mc_id=javascript-82212-ninarasi) which explains *Business Continuity(BC)* and *Disaster Recovery (DR)*.

This integration with other services is done through Connectors - the building blocks of the Power Platform.\\n\\n## What We\'ll Cover\\n * What is a Connector?\\n * Connectors Components\\n * Custom Components\\n * Certifying a Connector\\n * **Activity**: Sign up for your [Developer Plan](https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/devplan)\\n * **Resources**: Explore the [Low Code February Collection](https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/collection)\\n\\n\\n![Developer Tools and Onboarding](./../../../static/img/og/30-06.png)\\n\\n\\n## What is a Connector?\\n\\n A connector is a wrapper around an API that allows the underlying service to talk to the Power Platform. It\'s essentially a proxy that provides a way for users to connect their accounts and leverage a set of prebuilt actions and trigger to integrate the services with their apps and workflows.\\n\\nThe Power Platform offers a large ecosystem of software as a service connectors that enable you to connect apps, data and devices in the cloud. Some examples of popular connectors are Office 365, Outlook, Dropbox, Salesforce, Google Services and many many more.\\n\\n![Connector Architecture](./06_ConnectorsList.png)\\n\\nThere are hundreds of prebuilt connectors available to use in Power Apps, Power Automate and Logic Apps. You can see a list of all of the connectors available here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/connector-reference/](https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/connector-reference/)\\n\\n## Connectors Components\\n\\nEvery connector offers action and trigger operations. Let\'s explore each of those further.\\n\\n**Actions** are changes that are directed by a user. An action can be used to perform standard CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations in a data source like a SQL database. Each of these actions directly map to operations defined in the OpenAPI definition for the connector.\\n\\n**Triggers** allow you to kick off interaction with your connector when specific events occur. For example, the SharePoint connector has a trigger for when a new file is added and the Outlook connector has a trigger for when an email is received. You can build a Logic App or flow in Power Automate that listens to this trigger and performs an action whenever the trigger fires. Triggers are unique to Power Automate and Logic Apps and can\'t be used inside of Power Apps.\\n\\nThere are two types of triggers:\\n\\n* **Polling Triggers** which call your service at specified intervals to check for new data. When that new data is available, it causes a new run of your workflow instance with the data as an input.\\n* **Push Triggers** which wait for an event to occur that then causes a new run of your workflow instance.\\n\\n## Custom Connectors\\n\\nThe amount of out-of-the-box connectors for the Power Platform is growing every day, but sometimes you might want to call API\'s, services and systems that aren\'t available as prebuilt connectors. To support this need, you can build custom connectors that have their own triggers and actions.\\n\\nA connector is simply a wrapper around an API which means you can take any RESTful API that is defined in OpenAPI (Swagger) and make that accessible to the Power Platform with a custom connector.\\n\\n![Connector Architecture](./06_ConnectorArchitecture.png)\\n\\nYou can build custom connectors to connect to both public and private API\'s.\\n\\nConnections to private API\'s are possible with the [on-premises data gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/flow/gateway-reference).\\n\\nFor public API\'s that you want to create and manage, you might considering leveraging Azure products like [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/), [Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/) or [Azure API Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/api/).\\n\\nCustom connectors can either be used internally within your organization or you can get your connector certified so that it\'s publicly accessible for anyone in the world using the Power Platform and Logic Apps.\\n\\n## Certifying a Connector\\n\\nIf you want to make your custom connector publicly available you have to go through a certification process where Microsoft reviews the connector to see if it meets certification criteria and approves it for publishing.\\n\\nThere are two options when it comes to getting a connector certified:\\n\\n* **Verified Publisher** - To be eligible to get certified as a verified publisher, you must own the underlying service behind the connector.\\n* **Independent Publisher** - This gives you a chance to get your connector certified if you do not own the underlying service behind it.\\n\\nThe processes for certification vary depending on which option you qualify for. You can learn more about the process for getting your connector certified here:\\n\\n* [Independent publisher certification process](https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/certification-submission-ip)\\n* [Verified publisher certification process](https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/certification-submission)\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nStay tuned for the rest of this week\'s blog posts to dive deeper into the world of connectors and backend integrations.  \\n\\n* 1\ufe0f\u20e3 [**Sign up**](https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/devplan) for the free Power Apps Developer Plan.\\n* 2\ufe0f\u20e3 [**Enroll**](https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/challenge) in the Cloud Skills Challenge to learn more about low code and fusion team fundamentals and start climbing that leaderboard!\\n* 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Connectors will also be highlighted at the Powerful Devs Conference so be sure to [**Sign up**](https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/PowerfulDevsConf2023) for the free virtual event!\\n\\n## Resources\\n* [Introduction to the Power Platform](https://aka.ms/LowCodePowerPlatformIntro)\\n* [Fusion Development with Power Platform EBook](https://aka.ms/FusionDevEbook)\\n* [Fusion Development with Power Platform Learning Path](https://aka.ms/learn-fusiondev)"},{"id":"2023-day5","metadata":{"permalink":"/Low-Code/blog/2023-day5","source":"@site/blog/2023-lcf/2023-02-05/index.md","title":"5.

We have a surging digital demand with an estimated 500 million more apps that will need to be created in the next 5 years. More and more companies are leveraging low code and no code platforms to bridge this app gap and address workflow and automation needs. In fact, Gartner estimates that 65% of application development will be low code by 2024.\\n\\nWith low code tools like the Power Platform making it easier for business technologists to develop solutions, you might wonder if there\'s any room for a code first developer in this low code revolution. Well, the answer is, absolutely there is! In fact, code first developers are a critical piece to the puzzle.\\n\\n## What is \\"low code\\"?\\n\\nThe term \\"low code\\" can mean different things to different people when they first hear it. What we mean when we talk about low code is that with tools like Power Apps, you only need to write a small amount of code to get results that would normally take several more lines of code in a traditional programming language.\\n\\n![What is Low Code](./02_WhatIsLowCode.png)\\n\\nIn canvas-based Power Apps, the low code scripting language used is called [Power Fx](https://aka.ms/LearnPowerFx). This language is based on the Microsoft Excel formula language which meets many business technologists where they are by leveraging the knowledge they already have.\\n\\n## Low Code + Full Code = No Cliffs\\n\\nUsing low-code tools is key to helping to resolve the existing and impending app gap challenge but that doesn\'t mean that low code alone can solve every business problem. Low code tools like the Power Platform\'s full potential is unlocked when you combine the low code capabilities with code first development.\\n\\nThe combination of low code + full code creates what we call a \\"no cliffs\\" experience that allows business technologists to easily build solutions with low code while professional developers can leverage full code to augment and extend the platform capabilities. The process of low code developers, IT pros and full code developers working together like this is often referred to as \\"fusion development\\".\\n\\n![Fusion Development Process](./02_FusionDevProcess.png)\\n\\n## What does the Power Platform Provide?\\n\\nThe Power Platform gives us a holistic suite of low code tools that work together to help us solve business problems. The key products and components of the Power Platform include:\\n\\n* **Power Apps** for creating custom applications for web and mobile that can be integrated with a variety of systems and services.\\n* **Power Automate** for automation tasks and orchestrating activities across various services\\n* **Power BI** for business analytics and interactive data visualization\\n* **Power Virtual Agents** for creating AI-powered chatbots that can answer questions from your customers and employees\\n* **Power Pages** for secure, enterprise-grade external-facing business websites\\n* **Dataverse** which provides a cloud scale data store with robust security that abstracts away data management complexity from the app maker\\n\\n![Power Platform Overview](./02_PowerPlatformOverview.png)\\n\\n## How can we extend Power Platform solutions?\\n\\nYou might wondering how you can leverage your code first skills with the Power Platform. Let\'s take a look at some ways that we can extend our Power Platform solutions with code (many of these concepts will be covered in more detail in later blog posts).\\n\\n* **UI Components** - Leverage the [Power Apps Component Framework](https://aka.ms/LowCodePCF) to extend the UI of our applications with custom code.\\n* **Custom Connectors** - Create [custom connectors](https://aka.ms/LowCodeCustomConnectors), which are essentially a wrapper around an API to communicate to our external data sources and services.\\n* **Custom Visuals in Power BI** - Use the open-source SDK to create [custom visuals](https://aka.ms/LowCodeCustomVisuals) for your reports and dashboards\\n* **Custom Business Logic** - Extend the [Dataverse API](https://aka.ms/LowCodeDataverseAPI) with your own custom API that implements your business logic\\n* **Add CI/CD** - Setup continuous integration and continuous deployment ([CI/CD](https://aka.ms/LowCodeALM)) with your Power Platform solutions\\n\\n![Power Platform Pro Dev extensions](./02_Extend.png)\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nIn the next series of posts you\'ll learn more about some of these core concepts and extension points. \\n\\nIf all of this sounds intriguing and you want to get started on your low code development journey, here are some actions you can take:\\n\\n* 1\ufe0f\u20e3 [**Sign up**](https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/devplan) for the free Power Apps Developer Plan.\\n* 2\ufe0f\u20e3 [**Enroll**](https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/challenge) in the Cloud Skills Challenge to learn more about low code and fusion team fundamentals and start climbing that leaderboard!\\n* 3\ufe0f\u20e3 [**Save**](http://aka.ms/lowcode-february) the page to start your learning on Feb 1, and [**Subscribe**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/rss.xml) to the blog in your favorite feed reader for updates.\\n\\n## Resources\\n* [Introduction to the Power Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/introduction-power-platform//?WT.mc_id=power-82212-apdunnam)\\n* [Fusion Development with Power Platform EBook](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/guidance/fusion-dev-ebook/?WT.mc_id=power-82212-apdunnam)\\n* [Fusion Development with Power Platform Learning Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/transform-business-applications-with-fusion-development/?WT.mc_id=power-82212-apdunnam)\\n* [Learn Collection: LowCode February](https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/collection)\\n\\n![Campaign Banner](./../../../static/img/og/30-banner.png)"},{"id":"2023-day1","metadata":{"permalink":"/Low-Code/blog/2023-day1","source":"@site/blog/2023-lcf/2023-02-01/Feb01 - Hello.md","title":"1.

Low-code development with Azure helps businesses accelerate their innovation cycle and make the most out of their data resources. \\n\\nLow-code app development through Microsoft Power Platform and Azure can be used to automate workflows, reduce manual efforts, and speed up the development process for building line-of-business apps at a lower cost.\\n\\nAccording to [**Forrester**](https://aka.ms/2022ForresterTEI), composite organizations experience benefits of **140% ROI** and **45% cost reduction** in app development when using Power Platform premium capabilities. The majority of users say Power Platform\u2019s premium capabilities increase revenue and offers faster solution quoting through better data integration. \\n\\nIn other words, with Power Platform you\u2019ll produce more and better code than before, with increased cost savings. That means developing more projects and delivering increased value to your clients. With low code, everyone wins!\\n\\n![Empty Banner Placeholder](./01%20-%20Kickoff.png)\\n\\n## The full Low-Code February lineup\\n\\nWe want to give developers the resources you need to enhance your knowledge and skill in low code.
